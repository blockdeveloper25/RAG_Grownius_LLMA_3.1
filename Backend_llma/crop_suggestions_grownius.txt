**Crop Selection**
- Primary Crop: Pigeonpeas (already selected)
- Secondary Crop: Redgram or Groundnut for intercropping to enhance nitrogen fixation and reduce pest pressure.

**Irrigation Method**
- Best Irrigation Method: Drip irrigation to conserve water and reduce soil erosion, especially with 136.0456753 mm of rainfall recorded.

**Fertilizer Selection & Dosage**
- Fertilizer Type:
	+ Nitrogen (N): Urea or Ammonium Sulphate at a rate of 50 kg/ha.
	+ Phosphorus (P): DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate) at a rate of 40 kg/ha for its water-soluble form that promotes early growth stages.
	+ Potassium (K): Muriate of Potash at a rate of 30 kg/ha to maintain potassium levels in the soil.

**pH Level Adjustments**
- pH Adjustment: Lime application may be considered since the current pH level is slightly acidic (6.418062652000001), which could affect nutrient availability and crop growth.

**Essential Care Tips**

* Monitor humidity closely as pigeonpeas are sensitive to moisture stress; reduce irrigation if humidity levels drop below 30%.
* Regularly inspect the farm for signs of pests and diseases, especially whiteflies, thrips, and powdery mildew which can be prevalent at high temperatures.
* Apply neem cake or neem oil-based insecticides as part of integrated pest management to minimize chemical usage.
* Fertilizers should be applied based on soil test reports and not on standard doses, ensuring no over-fertilization.
* Maintain crop rotation practices to prevent soil nutrient depletion and enhance biodiversity.

**Other Considerations**
- Given the high temperature (35.95176642°C), ensure there is adequate moisture in the root zone to avoid moisture stress effects on pigeonpeas.

**Best Irrigation Method**:
* **Drip Irrigation**: to conserve water and reduce soil erosion
	+ Given the rainfall of 40.53173216 mm, drip irrigation will ensure that the water reaches the roots of the plants without wasting it on evaporation or runoff.
	+ This method also reduces soil erosion by minimizing the number of times the soil is disturbed.

**Fertilizer Type & Dosage**:
* **Organic Fertilizers**: to promote sustainable and balanced nutrient supply
	+ Given the nitrogen (9 ppm), phosphorus (35 ppm), and potassium (20 ppm) levels, a balanced fertilizer with NPK ratio of 15-15-15 will be applied.
	+ The dosage is calculated based on the soil test results and recommended rates for mungbean cultivation:
		- Nitrogen: 100 kg/ha
		- Phosphorus: 80 kg/ha
		- Potassium: 60 kg/ha

**Essential Care Tips**:

* **Crop Rotation**: to maintain soil fertility and reduce pests and diseases
	+ Rotate mungbean with cowpea every two years to avoid depleting the soil of nutrients.
* **Pest and Disease Management**: to minimize losses due to pests and diseases
	+ Monitor the crop regularly for signs of pests (e.g., aphids, whiteflies) or diseases (e.g., powdery mildew).
	+ Use integrated pest management techniques, such as introducing beneficial insects, practicing good hygiene, and using organic pesticides when necessary.
* **Soil Aeration**: to improve soil structure and promote healthy root growth
	+ Till the soil lightly after 20-25 days of sowing to improve aeration and reduce compaction.

**Additional Recommendations**:

* Monitor soil pH regularly and adjust fertilizers accordingly (pH level: 6.91380932).

**Soil pH Adjustment**
- Recommended pH Range for Muskmelon: 6.0 - 7.0.
- Adjust pH to maintain optimal range if necessary. Lime may be needed to increase pH; sulfur to decrease it.

**Care and Management Tips**

* **Watering:** Maintain consistent moisture levels, especially during flowering stages. Aim for about 70% of the field’s total annual rainfall through irrigation.
* **Pest and Disease Control:**
	+ Monitor regularly for aphids, whiteflies, and powdery mildew.
	+ Practice integrated pest management (IPM) to minimize chemical use.
* **Pruning:** Regular pruning promotes healthy growth, reduces water consumption, and encourages fruiting.
* **Mulching:** Apply a 3-inch layer of organic mulch around plants. This helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
